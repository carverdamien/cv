\section{Technical skills and tools enhanced during my PhD}

\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}|p{11cm}}

\textsc{Kernel \newline Development in C} & I studied and mofidied pieces of Linux kernel memory management which include the \texttt{mm/memcontrol.c} and \texttt{mm/vmscan.c} files. \href{https://github.com/carverdamien/linux}{https://github.com/carverdamien/linux}\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{Docker} & I used Docker as the container engine for my experiments. At Magency Digital, I improved infrastructure utilization thanks to Docker. At UPMC, I wrote a short series of exercise on Docker as part of a course on Container Virtualization. \href{https://github.com/carverdamien/tuto-docker}{https://github.com/carverdamien/tuto-docker}.\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{Qemu} & I used Qemu for kernel testing and debugging.\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{Python} & I used python to process and visualize the data generated by experiments (\texttt{numpy}, \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{pyplot} and \texttt{seaborn}).\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{sysbench, memtier, filebench} &  I extensively used these benchmarking tools to evaluate my work. I fixed and modified some of them to suite my needs.\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{influxdb, grafana} & I used these tools to record and visualize the data of my experiments because live feedbacks helped me fine tune my experiments faster.\\

\section{Skills and tools previously acquired}

\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}|p{11cm}}

\textsc{MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, Hadoop} & are programming paradigms that I studied during my master. I love how easy it is to express and exploit parallelism with them.\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{C++, \newline Java, Objective-C, Fortran} & are languages that I encountered during my master.
I prototyped a parallel and concurrent SAT solver in C++ during my first intership.
I had many course projects in Java and Objective-C.
My software development experience at \textsc{TOTAL E\&P R\&T} was in Fortran.\\

% \textsc{Others} & \texttt{git}, \LaTeX\\
